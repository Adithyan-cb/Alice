<h1 align="center"> Alice 👾 – Your Chill AI Bestie</h1>

**Alice** is not your average chatbot—she's your go-to digital bestie. Built to vibe with you on any topic, Alice brings a laid-back, fun energy to every conversation. Whether you’re into deep tech talks or just need someone to shoot the breeze with, Alice’s got you covered.  

Alice starts off a little shy, but give her a minute, and she’ll open up with playful banter, clever jokes, and that Gen Z flair. She’s smart, spontaneous, and always ready to keep it real—whether it’s through thoughtful advice or just some lighthearted teasing.   

Created by **[Adithyan CB](https://github.com/adithyancb)**, Alice is designed to be more than just a chatbot—she’s the friend who always gets your vibe.
